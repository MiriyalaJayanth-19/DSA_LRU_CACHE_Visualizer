# DSA Visualizer
- This repo will help in visualizing complex data structure algorithms

## 🗂️ LRU Cache
- An LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache stores a fixed number of items and evicts the least recently accessed one when full.
- It supports fast  and  operations, typically in O(1) time using a hash map + doubly linked list.
- This ensures frequently used data stays available while older, unused data is discarded automatically.

## ♛ N‑Queens Problem
- Place n queens on an n × n chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
-	Queens attack along rows, columns, and diagonals, so placements must avoid conflicts.
- The goal is to find all valid arrangements of queens that satisfy these constraints.
-	Commonly solved using backtracking algorithms with pruning for efficiency

## Features
- Interactive visualization
