# DSA LRU Cache Visualizer

The DSA LRU Cache Visualizer is a tool that illustrates how the LRU Cache algorithm works through a graphical interface. Users can visualize the cache's behavior with a series of operations, understanding how items are added, removed, and found in the cache.

## N-Queens Backtracking Visualization

The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic problem that seeks to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The visualization shows the algorithm's backtracking process as it explores various configurations of queen placements on the board. Users can step through each stage of the algorithm, observing how queens are placed and removed until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
